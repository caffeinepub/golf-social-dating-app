  "summary": "All four requirements (REQ-49, REQ-50, REQ-51, REQ-52) are implemented in the diff. Message buttons have been added to CourseDirectory, ProfileDetailPage, and MapView pages. ChatPage now supports auto-selecting conversations via sessionStorage. However, there is a significant backend limitation: the match profiles do not include Principal IDs, which prevents proper navigation to specific user conversations. This is acknowledged in the code comments and an alert message, but the requirements are technically implemented with a workaround using sessionStorage.",
