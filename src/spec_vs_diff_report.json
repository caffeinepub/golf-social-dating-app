  "summary": "The diff fully implements REQ-21. The Get Started button in LandingPage.tsx now has a click handler (handleAuth) that initiates Internet Identity authentication using the useInternetIdentity hook. The implementation includes error handling, loading state management, and matches the existing Login button functionality (both buttons use the same handleAuth function). The authentication flow redirects users appropriately based on their profile status, as confirmed by the App.tsx routing logic described in the frontend-file-summaries.txt.",
