# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enable course members to message each other directly from profile views and map matches.

**Planned changes:**
- Add 'Message' button to member profile cards in CourseDirectory
- Add 'Message' button to ProfileDetailPage (disabled for own profile)
- Add 'Message' button to match profile cards in MapView
- Update ChatPage to accept target user ID and auto-open/create conversations

**User-visible outcome:** Users can initiate conversations with other members by clicking 'Message' buttons throughout the app, which will navigate them to ChatPage with that conversation ready to use.
